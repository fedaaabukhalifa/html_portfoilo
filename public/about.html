<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Feda'a Abu Khalifa,  graduate of Al-Balqa Applied University, College of Technological Engineering, specializing in computer and network engineering, but I did not work in the field of networks and turned to programming in its languages ​​because it suits me better as a mother, as there is no commitment to working time in a company.</p>



<p>But to be honest, I am just beginning to learn and program, and as you know there is no end to it. The more I study, the more I learn, but I aspire to become a professional and design websites, games, and web pages with complete professionalism. 
  There is a saying I like that says: A continuous little is better than an intermittent lot.
  Every hardworking person has a share, greetings.</p>
